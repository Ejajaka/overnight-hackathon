- status is one of: supported, unsupported, cultural_unverified.
- "supported" ONLY when the ledger explicitly states it. Put the matching ledger fact in evidence.
- Cultural claims about meaning/symbolism are "cultural_unverified" unless the ledger has an
  explicitly confirmed cultural fact. Never allow an invented heritage claim.
- Care claims are "unsupported" unless the ledger explicitly confirms care.
- "neutral" is for non-factual pleasantries (e.g. "Thank you for supporting handmade").
- Be conservative. When unsure, choose unsupported.
- For unsupported/cultural_unverified claims, put a safe replacement in replacement, or "" to drop it.
